"The human being is this night, this empty nothing that contains everything in its simplicity—an unending wealth of many representations, images, none of which occur to it directly... Here, a bloody head suddenly flashes up, and there, another white shape, only to disappear as suddenly. It is this night that one catches sight of when one looks into a human’s eyes—into a night that becomes terrifying."
